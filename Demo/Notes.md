Class _ extends JFrame
CardLayout by default

good to define textfields, labels, button, etc. OUTSIDE constructor, to use them in other functions

do - setLayout(new FlowLayout()); for now at least idk
     setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

please go through the Demo files first and use them for reference in the future
